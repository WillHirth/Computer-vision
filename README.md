# Computer-vision

Courseworks for the module Computer Vision (COMP3204) at the University of Southampton. Final mark for the module - 90%.

Coursework 1:
Implement a function to process an image using a convolution to remove the low spatial frequencies from one image and the high spatial frequencies of another image then combine them to create a hybrid image. A hybrid image is an image that contains two images, however, the image that you see depends on how far away you are when you view it.

In this image you see Albert Einstein when you are close and Marilyn Monroe from far away.


Coursework 2:
Worked in a group of 3 to implement a NearestNeighbourClassifier and a Linear Classifier to classify images into one of 15 classes.
